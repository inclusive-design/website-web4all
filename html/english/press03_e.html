      <h4>Web-4-All Technology Helping St. John's Area Residents with Special 
        Needs Get Online</h4>
      <p> ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland and Labrador, March 11, 2003 &#8212; Senator 
        Joan Cook, on behalf of Industry Minister Allan Rock, today announced 
        the launch of a pilot project that is making assistive technology available 
        to people with disabilities or literacy challenges, as well as seniors 
        and new Canadians, so they can make better use of 14 local Community Access 
        Program (CAP) sites where the public can use the Internet.</p>
      <p>&quot;Making Web-4-All technology available at local public Internet 
        access sites helps residents of the greater St. John's area,&quot; said 
        Senator Cook. &quot;In particular, people who might otherwise not have 
        access to computer technology can now benefit from opportunities for innovative 
        learning, skills development, access to government services and business 
        creation.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;The demand for assistive technologies such as Web-4-All is continually 
        growing,&quot; said Minister Rock. &quot;For some Canadians, public Internet 
        access is their only way of getting online. Industry Canada's Web-4-All 
        pilot program is another important step in helping people and communities 
        use information technology to improve their quality of life.&quot;</p>
      <p>Developed by the University of Toronto's Assistive Technology Resource 
        Centre, Web-4-All uses &quot;smart card&quot; technology to help users 
        automatically configure public access computers to meet their individual 
        needs, such as having type faces enlarged or text read aloud. This innovative 
        technology makes CAP sites more accessible to those requiring non-standard 
        computer technology.</p>
      <p>Mary Reid, Executive Director of the St. John's Independent Living Resource 
        Centre, also welcomed this new service. &quot;For the people in the St. 
        John's area, the introduction of Web-4-All will enable computer access 
        with the swipe of a card,&quot; said Ms. Reid. &quot;Barriers that have 
        prevented disabled people and people with literacy challenges from using 
        public Internet sites will be reduced, and we will move another step closer 
        to equal access. Web-4-All, an exciting and innovative project of Industry 
        Canada, will ultimately decrease what is known as the digital divide.&quot;</p>
      <p>Industry Canada's Web-4-All pilot program is being funded through the 
        Government On-Line initiative. In addition to providing the Web-4-All 
        technology, Industry Canada contributed more than $40 000 to the St. John's 
        Independent Living Resource Centre to help start up this new service, 
        including the hiring of six young people with disabilities or literacy 
        challenges to install the systems and train users.</p>
      <p>To date, Industry Canada has distributed about 130 Web-4-All systems 
        to public Internet access sites across Canada. Bell Canada and the Royal 
        Bank of Canada together donated 26 000 smart cards for storing user preferences, 
        and Hitachi Canada contributed 1000 card readers for the pilot projects. 
        An evaluation of all components of the pilot is due by March 2004.</p>
      <p>Such leading-edge assistive technologies as Web-4-All contribute to Canada's 
        social, economic and cultural well-being by helping more Canadians develop 
        skills and be more innovative. They also support the Government On-Line 
        initiative, aimed at making government services easily accessible to all.</p>
