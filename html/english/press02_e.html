      <h4>Web-4-All Technology Helping South Shore Residents with Special Needs 
        Get On-line</h4>
      <p> BRIDGEWATER, Nova Scotia, April 4, 2003 &#8212; Senator Jane Cordy, 
        on behalf of Industry Minister Allan Rock, today announced the launch 
        of a pilot project that provides better access to the Internet for persons 
        with disabilities or low literacy levels. The technology, called Web-4-All, 
        allows users to automatically configure a computer to meet their individual 
        needs.</p>
      <p>&quot;This technology will enable more residents of the South Shore area 
        to benefit from public Internet access sites,&quot; said Senator Cordy. 
        &quot;In particular, people who might otherwise not have access to computer 
        technology can now benefit from opportunities for innovative learning, 
        skills development, access to government services and business creation.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;The demand for assistive technologies such as Web-4-All is continually 
        growing,&quot; said Minister Rock. &quot;For some Canadians, public Internet 
        access is their only way of getting online. Industry Canada's Web-4-All 
        pilot program is another important step in helping people and communities 
        use information technology to improve their quality of life.&quot;</p>
      <p>Developed by the University of Toronto's Assistive Technology Resource 
        Centre, Web-4-All's &quot;smart card&quot; technology enables computers 
        to adjust to individual user needs, such as having type faces enlarged 
        or text read aloud. This technology makes Community Access Program sites 
        more accessible to those requiring non-standard computer technology.</p>
      <p>The Senator unveiled the Web-4-All technology during an international 
        best practices conference on devices and services for people with disabilities 
        and those who help them. The conference was co-hosted by the South Shore 
        region's Assistive Technology Centre, one of four local Community Access 
        Program sites participating in the Web-4-All pilot program. The Centre 
        is a leader in providing technology-related support to people with disabilities. 
        (A list of the four Community Access Program sites follows.)</p>
      <p>&quot;The Web-4-All program has great potential for improving the lives 
        of many people with disabilities,&quot; said Barbara Welsford, Coordinator 
        of the Assistive Technology Centre. &quot;During the short time Web-4-All 
        has been in the South Shore area, there has been a strong interest in 
        this exciting new technology. It is a significant step toward bridging 
        the digital divide in Internet access for people with disabilities.&quot;</p>
      <p>Industry Canada's Web-4-All pilot program is being funded through the 
        Government On-Line initiative. In addition to providing the Web-4-All 
        technology, Industry Canada contributed more than $40 000 to the Assistive 
        Technology Centre of Bridgewater to hire four young persons with disabilities 
        or low literacy levels to install the systems and train users.</p>
      <p>Industry Canada plans to distribute a total of 1000 Web-4-All systems 
        to public Internet access sites in selected communities across Canada. 
        Bell Canada and the Royal Bank together donated 26 000 smart cards for 
        use in storing user preferences, and Hitachi Canada contributed 1000 card 
        readers for the pilot projects. An evaluation of all components of the 
        pilot program is due by March 2004.</p>
      <p>Such leading-edge assistive technologies as Web-4-All contribute to Canada's 
        social, economic and cultural well-being by helping more Canadians develop 
        skills and be more innovative. They also support the Government On-Line 
        Initiative, aimed at making government services easily accessible to all.</p>
