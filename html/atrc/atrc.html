    <h3>Web-4-All: The Technology</h3>
    <hr>
      <!-- CONTENT -->
      <h5>The Problem</h5>
      <p>Libraries, schools, colleges, universities, government offices and Internet 
        Cafes all provide access to computer workstations that are used by multiple 
        users each with their own personal set-up preferences or requirements. 
        Depending on the technical support available, users presently make do 
        with the workstation as it is, or spend a great deal of time and effort 
        adjusting the workstation to an approximation of their requirements. Many 
        users with disabilities cannot use these workstations, even when they 
        are &quot;accessible&quot; workstations, because the technology they need 
        is not available or the technical support is not available to set it up 
        the way they need it. In addition, institutions offering and maintaining 
        public workstations are often reluctant to include assistive technologies 
        in the set-up because the technologies conflict with one another or with 
        other software and hardware on the system.</p>
      <h5>The Solution</h5>
      <p>Web-4-All is the first technology in the world that makes it possible 
        for users to carry with them their user interface preferences (including 
        system preferences, browser preferences and assistive technology preferences) 
        and automatically configure public terminals or learning management applications 
        to suit their preferences and access requirements. Web-4-All automatically 
        configures public access terminals according to personal set-up preferences 
        (for the system, the browser and the assistive technology), as saved onto 
        a smart card or other Open Card compliant device. Each Web-4-All user's 
        interface preference is saved as a compressed XML string and uses 2K of 
        storage. It is created using a personal <a href="../english/pwd_e.html">preference 
        wizard program</a>. Once saved to the card, the user can take the card 
        to any public access terminal running Web-4-All software, insert or swipe 
        the card, and cause the system preferences, browser preferences, and assistive 
        technology preferences to be set exactly as they have specified. The user 
        is able to specify the assistive technology they prefer, as well as acceptable 
        alternatives if the preferred technology is not installed on the workstation. 
        If none of the preferred technologies are present, the system will resort 
        to a technology in the same class. When the card is removed, the workstation 
        reverts back to the default configuration and all assistive technologies 
        are shut down to avoid conflict with other users.</p>
      <h5>Web-4-All Preferences</h5>
      <p>WithinWeb-4-All, preferences are grouped into three main branches: display, 
        control and content. &quot;Display&quot; is used to describe how the user 
        interface and the content should be displayed and lists preferences relevant 
        to technologies that offer alternative or enhanced displays such as screen 
        enhancers, screen readers or Braille displays. &quot;Control&quot; specifies 
        how the user interface and content should be controlled and applies to 
        various keyboard, mouse, and alternative input devices and enhancements. 
        &quot;Content&quot; specifies preferred or required content alternatives 
        or augmentations such as captioning and video description. For each class 
        of technology, there is a generic set of preferences that is common across 
        technologies within the class, and a method of specifying technology-specific 
        preference settings that would only apply to a specific product. A user 
        can create different Web-4-All instances for different contexts.</p>
      <h5>Web-4-All National Pilots</h5>
      <p>The first public implementation of Web-4-All's user-driven interface 
        preferences is through a Canadian national pilot initiative being undertaken 
        by Industry Canada with support from Bell Canada, the Royal Bank of Canada, 
        and Hitachi Canada. Web-4-All was developed for Industry Canada by the 
        Adaptive Technology Resource Centre (ATRC) of the University of Toronto. 
        </p>
      <h5>Web-4-All and 3rd. Party Technologies</h5>
      <p>An API has been published by the ATRC to allow assistive technology developers 
        to create Preference Wizard and Configuration Manager plug-ins for their 
        assistive technologies. With a common specification for user preference 
        settings and a tool to implement those specifications on Web-4-All at 
        public workstations, any user should be able to step up to a public workstation 
        and access the assistive technology they are most comfortable with using. 
        The implementation of this common specification will reduce the need for 
        technical support and reduce software conflicts with assistive technologies. 
        Most importantly it will provide a sustainable and realistic method of 
        maintaining accessible public workstations in public institutions and 
        businesses. </p>
      <h5>Invitation</h5>
      <p>We invite all developers of assistive technologies to explore how they 
        might have their assistive technology accessed at public work stations 
        through Web-4-All. A demonstration copy of Web-4-All's Preference Wizard 
        is included on this site for you to view first hand how 3rd. party assistive 
        technologies are referenced by Web-4-All users. Additionally, we encourage 
        you to review the documentation contained on this site, and to contact either 
        Industry Canada or the Adaptive Technology Resource Centre, to learn how 
        your assistive technology and Web-4-All can work together. The complete 
        Web-4-All Preference Wizard Programmers manual has been included on this 
        site. To view this manual click the following link:</p>

      <h5> The IMS ACCLIP Specification: A Portable Personal Preference Language</h5>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/" target="_blank">IMS Global Learning 
        Consortium</a>, an international consortium that develops open technical 
        specifications to support distributed learning, has released a specification 
        that is of great significance to assistive technology developers. The 
        Accessibility for Learner Information Package (ACCLIP) Specification is 
        a schema and model for describing and recording individual preferences 
        regarding the user interface and the selective retrieval of content for 
        computer mediated learning systems. A large portion of the specification 
        is devoted to preferences that are relevant to assistive technologies. 
        This site includes the following specification, supporting documents and 
        an example implementation.</p>
