Community Engagement Guidelines Used for the Pilot Phase<br>
Web 4 All Pilot Project<br>
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Public Internet access sites have had a tremendous impact on their
communities. The reason for this is simple: public Internet access works
because it meets real needs and helps bridge the digital divide.
</p>
<p>
We are, therefore, pleased to invite you to participate in an innovative
Industry Canada pilot program that is aimed at reducing Internet barriers
for persons with disabilities or low literacy levels. The goal of the pilot
is to establish networks of sites across the country with public access
computers equipped with an assistive technology called Web-4-All.
</p>
<p>
Developed by the University of Toronto's Assistive Technology Resource
Centre, Web-4-All's "smart card" technology enables computers equipped with
a Web-4-All system to adjust to individual user needs, such as having
typefaces enlarged or text read aloud. This technology will benefit a wide
range of individuals with challenges, from seniors with failing eyesight to
people with limited movement or literacy abilities.
</p>
<p>
Web-4-All is the first technology in the world capable of automatically
loading individual user preferences on shared computers. Without this Web-
4-All technology, setting up a computer for multiple users requires
expertise and technology that is not always readily available. (See the
attached document titled Web-4-All System Requirements for a list of
components and requirements for operation at public Internet access sites.)
</p>
<p>
People previously unable to use computers can now access information and
participate on-line. Web-4-All's unique "URL Storage Bin" further
facilitates on-line connectivity by enabling local Web-4-All networks to
establish a Web presence on the Internet complete with local links and
announcements. Each user is supplied with a customizable personal links
storage tool that permits access from any location: www.web-4-all.ca.
</p>
<p>
Everyone in your community has the right to participate in public programs
and services provided by your facility. Introducing accessible technologies
such as Web-4-All can assist public Internet access sites to successfully
connect with all citizens and eliminate the digital divide in your
community. To determine whether your network is eligible to receive free
Web-4-All packages, review the attached document, Web-4-All Site Selection
Criteria.
</p>
<p>
In order to assist you in better connecting your community and making it
accessible to everyone, we are pleased to offer the enclosed Community
Engagement Guidelines in multiple formats. Also enclosed is a Web-4-All
Loan agreement that you are welcome to complete and return to the Web
Accessibility Office at Industry Canada so
that you may receive a Web-4-All package to begin building your network of
accessible community Internet access sites.
</p>
<p>
To ensure that your network of accessible public Internet access sites is
sustainable, we recommend that you involve local disability and literacy
organizations. These groups can assist you in marketing the Web-4-All
technology and in identifying other resources that could further enhance
your network and site.
</p>
<p>
As well, you should consider involving other local Community Access Program
(CAP) sites from surrounding areas.
</p>
<p>
Attached is a list of steps to follow to set up a Web-4-All network in your
community.

<p>
Quick Facts - Steps for Establishing a Web-4-All Network
</p>
<p>
(More detailed information follows)
</p>
<p>
Step 1 - Establish a Local Web-4-All Advisory Group and Local Champion
</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact public Internet access sites in your community and surrounding
  areas to see which ones might be interested in establishing a Web-4-All
  network.
<li>Hold a meeting involving those sites interested in hosting Web-4-All. One
  of the main objectives of this meeting is to secure support for the
  network, and to create a Local Advisory Group. A brief description of the
  Local Advisory Group's roles and responsibilities follows.
<li>A Local Champion, who is responsible for coordinating the placement of
  Web-4-All packages throughout the network, should also be selected. A
  brief description of the Local Champion's roles and responsibilities
  follows.
</ul>
<p>
Step 2 - Local Advisory Group submits Web-4-All application to Industry
Canada's Web Accessibility Office
</p>
<ul>
<li>Once a Web-4-All network is established and a Local Champion is selected,
  your Local Advisory Group must submit a letter of application, based on
  the guidelines (see next page), to Industry Canada's Web Accessibility
  Office.
<li>If your application is successful, Industry Canada's Web Accessibility
  Office will ship the Web-4-All packages, including training materials and
  manuals, directly to each participating public Internet access site.
</ul>
<p>
Application Guidelines
</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide complete contact information for your Local Champion;
<li>Provide a list of your Local Advisory Group membership;
<li>Provide a summary of your first Local Advisory Group meeting;
<li>Review Site Selection Criteria and explain, in writing, how your network
  will meet the criteria;
<li>Indicate the number of Web-4-All systems required for your network, and
  provide the information required for each Web-4-All host site as listed
  in the document titled, "Host Site Contact Information";
<li>Indicate which proposed Web-4-All host sites already participate in
  Industry Canada's "Community Access Program";
<li>Indicate the language preferred for each system (French or English).
</ul>
<p>
Web-4-All System Requirements
</p>
<p>
Web-4-All consists of a number of assistive technologies. The software
components include:

  FSL (French as a Second Language)/ESL (English as a Second Language); and
<li>Visual Dynamic Keyboard, alternative keyboard inputs for those with
  manual dexterity limitations.
</ul>
<p>
Web-4-All includes an external card reader, a supply of blank smart cards
and a track ball, which replaces the mouse. Installation, support, and
training documentation in alternate formats (braille, large print, audio
tape, and plain e-text) are included as well.
</p>
<p>
The package runs on a Pentium III or better computer with a CD-ROM drive,
sound card and speakers, at least 256 MB of memory, and Windows 2000.
</p>
<p>
Web-4-All Site Selection Criteria

<p>
Planning a Network launch of Web-4-All systems with Industry Canada
Why do a public launch of your network?
</p>
<p>
A public launch of the Web-4-All technology is a good way to raise
awareness in your community about your initiative. Successful launches by
other Web-4-All networks have resulted in stories appearing in the Globe
and Mail (on-line edition) and major local papers.
</p>
<p>
Checklist on how to plan an event
</p>
<ul>
<li>Should your network wish to hold a public event, you must inform Industry
  Canada's Web Accessibility Office at least 30 days in advance of any
  potential event. It should be noted that dates for events must be chosen
  that are convenient for all partners, including Industry Canada.
<li>Any public event should involve a federal representative, where possible.
  With advanced notice (30 days), the Web Accessibility Office can help you
  secure the participation of a federal representative, such as the
  Minister or a local Member of Parliament, for your launch event.
<li>To facilitate the participation of a federal representative, Industry
  Canada requires that events be scheduled on Mondays, Fridays and days
  when the House is not is session. (The Parliamentary calendar is
  available on the Internet at http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/
  process/house/calendar/HseCal-e.htm )
<li>In selecting a date for your event, Industry Canada prefers that more
  than one potential date is given for each event. The department will aim
  to select the preferred date within 10 days of receiving appropriate
  notice.* (Appropriate notice is giving at least 30 days' advance notice
  of any potential event and planning a event on Mondays, Fridays or days
  when the House isn't sitting.)
<li>Industry Canada will provide communications support and materials for
  launch events. These materials include an Industry Canada press release,
  a backgrounder of Web-4-All, and a list of the Web-4-All sites involved
  in the launch event.
