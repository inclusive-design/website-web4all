<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>



<p>The previous documents described the minimum requirements for
implementing a plug-in such as drawing up a properties file in the
correct way and implementing a plug-in interface. For configuration
plug-ins, however, the Web-4-All jar also includes a library of code
that encapsulates a variety of common operations.&nbsp; The package <code>ca.utoronto.atrc.web4all.configuration</code>
provides a set of utilities that facilitate plug-in
implementation.&nbsp; In addition, the Control Hub provides functions
that retrieve information defined by the plug-in's ".properties" file.<br>
</p>



<p>This document describes these supports available to a developer when
implementing a configuration plug-in.&nbsp; The Control Hub's
information retrieval functions are discussed first.<br>
</p>



<p><a href="#Table_of_Contents">back to top</a><br>
</p>



<h2><a name="Property_Utilities"></a>Property Utilities</h2>



<p>When the Web-4-All system launches, it locates plug-ins by examining
the "3rd_party" folder, looking for ".properties" files.&nbsp; It is
assumed that each file defines the characteristics of a plug-in.&nbsp;
The Control Hub loads each property file, and stores it according to
both its "appID" and "appType" properties.&nbsp; This enables plug-ins
to access their core and local properties by querying the Control
Hub.&nbsp; The following section, "<a href="#Properties_via_the_Control_Hub">Properties via the Conrol Hub</a>",
describes the methods of the ControlHub that a plug-in can use to
recover its core properties.&nbsp; The section following that, "<a href="#Local_properties_-_class">Local Properties - class
AbstractSetterLauncher</a>", describes how the plug-in can access its
local properties.<br>
</p>



<h3><a name="Properties_via_the_Control_Hub"></a>Properties via the
Control Hub</h3>



<p>Each core property is listed below along with a corresponding
Control Hub method.&nbsp; The Control Hub method provides access to the
core property.&nbsp; Note that all properties are read only.&nbsp; Note
also that the first property, appID, is not retrieved from the Control
Hub, but from the <code>AccLipInfoPackage</code> instance used to
"call" the plug-in.<br>
</p>



<dl><dt>appID </dt><dd>The appID, or application name, is taken from an <code>AccLipInfoPackage</code>
and then passed to the plug-in via the <code>AccLipInfoPackage.getSpecificPrefs()</code>
method which returns the <code>&lt;application&gt;</code> element from
the ACCLIP.&nbsp; One of the attributes of that element is a <code>name</code>
attribute, whose value is the appID.<br>
    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">Note:&nbsp;&nbsp; The class <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code>
has a <code>setAppID()</code> method, that takes an <code>&lt;application&gt;</code>
element as input and determines the appID from it.&nbsp; Thus, a plug-in
derived from <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code> can call <code>AccLipInfoPackage.getSpecificPrefs()</code>,
passing the returned value to <code>setAppID()</code> to retrieve the
application name from the preferences document, and store it within the
plug-in.

<h3><a name="Local_properties_-_class"></a>Local properties - class AbstractSetterLauncher</h3>



<p>As noted earlier, the configuation plug-in API is defined by <code>interface
ca.utoronto.atrc.web4all.configuration.SetterLauncher</code>.&nbsp;
That interface has a method <code>initLocalProps()</code>.&nbsp; Since
the local properties are understood only by the plug-in, implementors
have complete control over how they define these properties, and how to
use them.&nbsp; Web-4-All does not constrain the implementation of <code>initLocalProps()</code>
in any way.&nbsp; However, the class <code>ca.utoronto.atrc.web4all.configuration.AbstractSetterLauncher</code>
defines a default way of initializing the plug-in's local properties,
and a default method for acquiring a property.</p>



<p>It works as follows:&nbsp; The Control Hub has a method allowing
plug-ins access to their local properties.&nbsp; This method's
signature is:<br>
</p>
<blockquote><code>public ResourceBundle get3rdPartyProperties (String inAppID) throws MissingResourceException;</code></blockquote>
<p>The plug-in provides its appID, and the
Control Hub returns <em>all</em> of the properties for that application
as a <code>java.util.ResourceBundle</code>.&nbsp; If no such
application exists as defined by the <code>inAppID</code> argument,
then a <code>java.util.MissingResourceException</code> is thrown.<br>
</p>



<p><code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code> implements <code>initLocalProps()</code>
by calling the Control Hub's <code>get3rdPartyProperties()</code>, and
then storing that <code>ResourceBundle</code> locally.&nbsp; If the
plug-in needs to do more than this, then a sub-class can override this
behaviour by first using it as is, and then adding the required extra functionality.<br>
</p>



<p><code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code> also provides a utility method
for acquiring a given local property.&nbsp; A plug-in derived from <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code>
can use this to acquire a known local property.&nbsp; The method's
signature is:<br>
</p>
<blockquote><code>protected String getLocalProperty (String inPropName) throws MissingResourceException;<br>
</code></blockquote>
<p><code></code>By passing the name of the property, its value is
returned, if any such property exists.&nbsp; If not, then a <code>MissingResourceException</code>
is thrown.&nbsp; Note that <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code> expects
that its <code>initLocalProps()</code> method to have been called prior
to using the <code>getLocalProperty()</code> method; that is, the
properties must have been stored internally before they are queried.<br>
</p>

<h2><a name="Method_Utilities_"></a>Method Utilities<br>
</h2>



<h3><a name="Nomenclature"></a>Nomenclature</h3>



<p>In order to distinguish between technology settings as the technology itself uses them, and
the corresponding preferences in the ACCLIP, they are described in two
ways in this document.&nbsp; The terms "preference" and "preference
value" refer to the preference in the ACCLIP document.&nbsp; The terms
"parameter" and "setting" refer to the way a third party technology
represents that preference.&nbsp; Both preferences and parameters have
two aspects: a name and a value.&nbsp; For example, suppose the ACCLIP
has an alternative pointing device <em>preference</em> whose <em>name</em>
is "doubleClickSpeed" and whose <em>value</em> is&nbsp; "0.4".&nbsp;
That preference maps to the Kensington Trackball <em>parameter</em> <em>named</em>
"DBL_CLICK_SPEED" and to the <em>value</em> "416".<br>
</p>



<p>In summary, "preference" refers to some content within the ACCLIP,
"parameter" or "setting" to a third-party technology setting, "name" to
the name of a preference or parameter, and "value" to its value.<br>
</p>



<h3><a name="class_AbstractSetterLauncher"></a>class
AbstractSetterLauncher</h3>



<h4><a name="Translation"></a>Translation<br>
</h4>



<p>What does a configuration plug-in do?&nbsp; Most of the work
involves translating the preferences as defined in the ACCLIP schema to
a form that a specific technology can use.&nbsp; The complexity of the
translation ranges from simple and straightforward to complicated and
involved.&nbsp; An example of the simple case is where the ACCLIP
encodes volume as a floating point value in the range [0.0, 1.0].&nbsp;
A gvien technology might represent volume as a signed single byte
integer in the range [-127, 128].&nbsp; The translation from the ACCLIP
to the technology's setting is a simple linear relationship.&nbsp; At
the other extreme, speech pitch is represented as a relative value,
again in the range [0.0, 1.0], in the ACCLIP.&nbsp; To represent a
relatively low pitch, say 0.2, a speech synthesizer might be configured
to use an adult male voice.&nbsp; Similarly, a high-pitched voice is
achieved by using a woman's or perhaps a child's voice.<br>
</p>



<h5><a name="Value_Maps"></a>Value Maps<br>
</h5>



<p><code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code> has a mechanism for performing
arbitrarily complex translation via a mapping lookup table.&nbsp; That
is, a plug-in derived from <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code> can
install any number of "value maps", a "value map chooser", and a "name
map".<br>
</p>



<p>A <em>value map</em> is a lookup table that defines a relationship
between the ACCLIP preference value and technology's setting.&nbsp;
Using the voice pitch example from the previous paragraph, the plug-in
could use a "voice pitch value map" that maps floating point pitch
values to various synthesizer voices.<br>
</p>



<p>The <em>value map chooser</em> is another lookup table that, given
an technology parameter name, chooses the appropriate value map.&nbsp;
This is most useful when the plug-in employs a number of different
value maps for each distinct preference.&nbsp; In this case, the lookup
is performed based on the technology parameter name:&nbsp; Again, using
the voice pitch example, the plug-in sees that there is a "pitch"
preference in the ACCLIP.&nbsp; It passes the corresponding parameter
name to <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code>'s value map chooser, which
looks up the correct value map (here, the pitch map), and then
determines the parameter value from the map and the ACCLIP value.&nbsp;
This results in the correct parameter value.<br>
</p>



<p>Finally, there is a third type of map that associates ACCLIP
preference names with technology parameter names.&nbsp; This map is
termed a <em>name map</em>.<br>
</p>



<p>If you wish to use <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code>'s value map
machinery, there are some restrictions.&nbsp; With respect to the value
maps and value map chooser, a plug-in can define them in any way it sees
fit, however, they must be derived from <code>java.util.ResourceBundle</code>.&nbsp;
The name map, however, must be a <code>ca.utoronto.atrc.web4all.configuration.SettingsBundle</code>,
or be derived from that class.<br>
</p>



<p>A <code>SettingsBundle</code> is a <code>java.util.ListResourceBundle</code>
with one extra feature.&nbsp; It has a technology-type characteristic,
and a method to query it for that type (<code>SettingsBundle.getTechType()</code>).&nbsp;
The ACCLIP schema defines the type returned.<br>
</p>



<p>Recall that a technology can satisfy more than one type, e.g., it
can be both a screen reader and a screen enhancer.&nbsp; Since a
technology might by multi-type, its configuration plug-in would need to
define distinct <code>SettingsBundle</code> instances for each
type.&nbsp; This is consistent with the information passed to the
plug-in in the form of a list of <code>AccLipInfoPackage</code>
instances.&nbsp; Each of these is defined in terms of a technology type
as well.&nbsp; There should be a one-to-one correspondence between the <code>AccLipInfoPackage</code>
technology types, and the <code>SettingsBundle</code> types.<br>
</p>



<p>The <code>SettingsBundle</code> object contains a lookup table whose
keys are ACCLIP preferences names.&nbsp; The value associated with each
key is an instance of a <code>ca.utoronto.atrc.web4all.configuration.ParameterState</code>.&nbsp;
A <code>ParameterState</code> object is an object that maintains an
association between a parameter name, whether that parameter has been
"written", whether it is required that it be written, and its default
value.&nbsp; For the moment, consider only the parameter name:&nbsp; the <code>SettingsBundle</code>
performs the function of mapping the ACCLIP preference name to a
specific technology's parameter name.&nbsp; That parameter name is then
used in conjunction with the value map chooser to locate the
appropriate value map.<br>
</p>



<p>In a nutshell, here is how a plug-in uses <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code>'s
value map system.&nbsp; First, create a <code>ResourceBundle</code> for
each of the technology's settings, that maps an ACCLIP preference value
to a technology's parameter value.&nbsp; Each constitutes a <em>value
map</em>.<br>
</p>



<p>Second, create another <code>ResourceBundle</code> whose keys are
the technology parameter names.&nbsp; Each name maps to one of the value maps
created in step one.&nbsp; This is the <em>value map chooser</em>.<br>
</p>



<p>Third, create a <code>SettingsBundle</code> whose keys are the names
of ACCLIP preferences, and whose values are <code>ParameterState</code>
objects that each contains a parameter name.&nbsp; These parameter names
are inputs to the value map chooser created at step two.&nbsp; Create
one such <code>SettingsBundle</code> for each type of technology that
the plug-in handles.&nbsp; An algorithm for mapping from an ACCLIP
preference to a technology setting is as follows:<br>
</p>



<ol>



  <li>Retrieve the technology type from the <code>AccLipInfoPackage</code>.</li>
  <li>Use the technology type to choose a <code>SettingsBundle</code>.</li>
  <li>Given an ACCLIP preference name, use the <code>SettingsBundle</code>
to retrieve a <code>ParameterState</code>, and, from it, the
corresponding parameter name.</li>
  <li>Use that parameter name and the value map chooser to choose the
correct value map.</li>
  <li>Given an ACCLIP preference value, use the value map to transfrom
it into the correct parameter value.</li>
  <li>Set the technology's parameter with that value.</li>
</ol>



<p>With the proper initialization, <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code>
performs steps one through five "for free".&nbsp; The initialization is
accomplished via the methods:<br>
</p>
<blockquote><code>protected void init();</code> and<br><code>protected void
setUpParameters (SettingsBundle[] inParams, ResourceBundle
inValueMapChooser);</code></blockquote>
<p>The former is abstract, and must be
implemented in the derived class.&nbsp; It is advised that, at least,
the derived class call the <code>setUpParameters()</code> method from
its <code>init()</code> method.&nbsp; The first argument is an array of <code>SettingsBundle</code>
objects, where each member of the array is distinct in terms of a type
of technology.&nbsp; The second argument is the value map chooser, i.e.
the lookup table that maps parameter names to value maps.<br>
</p>



<p>The sequence outlined above is accomplished by a number of <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code>'s
methods.&nbsp; Steps two and three are handled by the <code>findParameter()</code>
methods.&nbsp; Steps four and five by the<code> mapValue()</code>
method.&nbsp; Steps two through five are effectively accomplished by <code>handlePref()</code>,
by essentially calling <code>findParameter()</code> and <code>mapValue()</code>
in succession.&nbsp; All of these methods are are fully documented in
the <a href="javaDocs/index.html" title="Web-4-All Plugin API">plug-in API documentation</a>.<br>
</p>



<h5><a name="Linear_Transformations"></a>Linear Transformations<br>
</h5>



<p>Value maps are useful for complex relationships between ACCLIP
preference values and an application's parameter values.&nbsp;
Frequently, there is a simpler mathematical equation that will transform
an preference value to the correct parameter setting.&nbsp; <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code>
provides one of these; specifically, a method that performs a linear
transform.&nbsp; Its signature is:<br>
</p>
<blockquote><code>public float linearCalcTechVal (String inAccLipVal, float
inSlope, float inIntercept);
</code></blockquote>
<p><code></code>The
caller passes in the ACCLIP value (<span style="font-style: italic;">x</span>),
a slope (m), and intercept (b).&nbsp; The method returns the value (<span style="font-style: italic;">y</span>) transformed according to the
linear equation <span style="font-style: italic;">y</span> = m<span style="font-style: italic;">x</span> + b.<br>
</p>



<p><a href="#Table_of_Contents">back
to top</a><br>
</p>



<h4><a name="Parameter_Writing"></a>Parameter "Writing"<br>
</h4>



<p>Once the translation is complete, the technology's setting must be
realized.&nbsp; In our experience, there are two ways to accomplish
this.&nbsp; First, some technologies take their settings from an
initialization file; for example, on Windows, a file with the extension
".ini".&nbsp; This is a text file consisting of parameter names and
values.&nbsp; When the technology starts up, it configures itself
according to the contents of this ".ini" file.<br>
</p>



<p>Secondly, some technologies use "registry" values as their parameter
settings.&nbsp;&nbsp; In that case, it is useful to translate the ACCLIP
preferences into an array of in-memory parameter values, which are then
transferred to the appropriate place in the registry.<br>
</p>



<p><code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code> provides methods for both writing
to an initialization file, and installing settings into a
registry.&nbsp; The former is accomplished via the <code>createOutput()</code>
methods, and the <code>writeSetting()</code> methods.&nbsp; The latter
by the methods <code>createArgsArray()</code>, <code>setArgsArray()</code>,<code>
setArgsIndexMap()</code>, and <code>addArgToArray()</code>.<br>
</p>



<p>If your plug-in requires an initialization file, use one of the <code>createOutput()</code>
methods to create the initialization file. The difference in the methods
is that they provide different ways of defining the path to the
intialization file.&nbsp; In one case, the path is relative to the
directory from which Web-4-All was launched.&nbsp; In a second case, it
is relative the the Web-4-All's plug-in folder.&nbsp; Finally, a full
path to the file can be specified.&nbsp; In all cases, <code>createOutput()</code>creates
and records the file, and returns it as a <code>java.io.PrintWriter</code>.&nbsp;
The <code>writeSetting()</code> methods use this <code>PrintWriter</code>
to output the parameter name and its value.&nbsp; These ".ini" related
methods are are fully documented in the <a href="javaDocs/index.html" title="Web-4-All Plugin API">plug-in API documentation</a>. </p>



<p>An alternative technique to writing parameters to a file is one that uses an in-memory
argument array, and is based on the idea that a command line utility
will be used to transfer the settings to something similar to a
registry.&nbsp; The command line arguments are represented as a <code>String</code>
array.&nbsp; The array can either be created by using <code>createArgsArray()</code>,
or passed in if <code>setArgsArray()</code> is used.<br>
</p>



<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p> Note:&nbsp; The use of a command line utility to write settings to a
"registry" was employed to avoid specifically committing to the Windows
regsitry.&nbsp; The <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code> class could have
been implemented such that it transferred relevant parameter settings
directly to the registry, but that would not have been platform
neutral.&nbsp; By deferring the writing of the "registry" to a command
line utility, the transfer utility can move the settings wherever it is
appropriate.<br>
</p>



<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p>It is assumed that the argument array is positional, e.g., that the
third argument represents, say, the volume setting.&nbsp; As such, there
must also exist a technique that, based on the parameter, places the
setting in the correct position of the array.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plug-ins that
use the argument array feature of <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code>
must also provide an index map via the <code>setArgsIndexMap()</code>
method.&nbsp; The argument index map is a <code>ResourceBundle</code>
whose keys are parameter names, and whose value is the index in the
argument array for that parameter.&nbsp; The place to initialize the
arguments index map is in the plug-in's implementation of <code>init()</code>.&nbsp;
When <code>addArgToArray()</code> is called, it will use the parameter
name and argument index map to place the parameter value in the proper
position of the argument array.</p>



<p>When all preferences have been processed, the completed argument
array can be retrieved via the <code>getArgsArray()</code> method.&nbsp;
At that point, it is up to the plug-in to do what is necessary with the
argument list.&nbsp; That is, <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code> does
not define any method to transfer the settings to the "registry"; it
only provides a means to collect the settings.&nbsp; Like the
initialization file writing methods, these argument array methods are
fully described in the <a href="javaDocs/index.html" title="Web-4-All Plugin API">plug-in API documentation</a>. </p>



<p>Finally, the reader might wonder why <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code>
has a set of methods both for writing settings to an initialization
file, and another set for creating an positional parameter list.&nbsp;
Why not factor this functionality out between two implementations of
interface <code>SetterLauncher</code>?&nbsp; The answer is that some
plug-ins require both techniques for "writing" settings.&nbsp; That is,
some plug-ins will write certain settings to an initialization file, and
other settings to a registry.&nbsp; Placing the writing utilities all
in a single class allows a derived class to write exclusively to an
initialization file, or exclusively to a registry, or to both.<br>
</p>



<p><a href="#Table_of_Contents">back

</p>



<h3><a name="Implementing_doSettings"></a>Implementing interface
SetterLauncher.doSettings()</h3>



<p><code>doSettings()</code> is one method that <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code>
does <em>not</em> implement.&nbsp; However, <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code>
does implement a number of other methods out of which an implementation
of <code>doSettings()</code> can be built.<br>
</p>



<p>Conceptutally, <code>doSettings()</code> amounts to examining the
ACCLIP preferences passed to it, translating them, and writing the
translations.&nbsp; The ACCLIP contains a set of generic preferences,
and, potentially, a set of technology-specific preferences.&nbsp; <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code>
defines two loop methods, one for handling the generic settings, and
another for the specific settings.<br>
</p>



<h4><a name="Generic_Loop"></a>Generic Loop</h4>



<p>The signature of the generic loop method is:<br>
</p>
<blockquote><code>protected void loopThruGenerics (String inTechType, Element
inGenericContainer);
</code></blockquote>
<p>Note that the first argument defines the type of technology (e.g.,
onscreen keyboard). For each generic preference in the <code>inGenericContainer</code>,<code>loopThruGenerics()</code>
does the following:<br>
</p>



<ol>



  <li>Map the name of ACCLIP preference to the technology's parameter
name.</li>
  <li>Retrieve the value of the preference.</li>
  <li>Map that value to the parameter's value.</li>
  <li><em>Write</em> out the parameter value.</li>
</ol>



<p>Note the emphasis on "Write" in step&nbsp; four.&nbsp; At this
point, <code>loopThruGenerics()</code> dispatches to the method <code>doWriteSetting()</code>,
which is another abstract method of <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code>.&nbsp;
Its signature is:<br>
</p>
<blockquote><code>protected void doWriteSetting (String inProperty, String
inValue);<br>
</code></blockquote>
<p>where <code>inProperty</code> is a
parameter name, and <code>inValue</code> is its value.&nbsp; <code>doWriteSetting()</code>
can be implemented by calling one of the <code>writeSetting()</code>
methods described above, or the <code>addArgToArray()</code> method, or
both as required.&nbsp; This is why <code>doWriteSetting()</code> is
abstract -- how a specific plug-in actually outputs the setting cannot
be known by <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code>.&nbsp; It is up to the
implementor of the plug-in to determine how the setting is "written";
and, they can make use of the two utility methods that "write" the
setting.<br>
</p>



<h4><a name="Specific_Loop"></a>Specific Loop</h4>



<p>The corresponding loop for specific settings, <code>loopThru3rdPartyPrefs()</code>,
is identical&nbsp; in control flow to <code>loopThruGenerics</code>.&nbsp;
It is defined as a separate method, however, since it is likely that an
implementation of a plug-in will want to keep <code>loopThruGenerics</code>
as is, while completely replacing the technique for handling specific
settings.&nbsp; <br>
</p>



<p><a href="#Table_of_Contents">back
to top</a><br>
</p>



<h3><a name="Implementing_doLaunch"></a>Implementing interface
SetterLauncher.doLaunch()</h3>



<p>As with <code>doSettings()</code>, <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code>
does not define the <code>doLaunch()</code> method of <code>interface
SetterLauncher</code>.&nbsp; However, there are associated methods that
sub-classes should use to track the result of a <code>doLaunch()</code>.<br>
</p>



<p>It is assumed that plug-ins will make use of the <code>java.lang.Runtime()</code>
object and its <code>exec()</code> method to actually launch the third
party technology.&nbsp; <code>Runtime.exec()</code> returns an object of
type <code>java.lang.Process</code>.&nbsp; <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code>
defines the utilities <code>setProcess()</code> and a<code> getProcess() </code>in
order to make it easy for a sub-class to keep track of that <code>Process</code>,
if required.&nbsp; In addition to tracking the <code>Process</code>
launched, they are useful for the <code>SetterLauncher.kill()</code>
method.<br>
</p>



<h3><a name="Implementing_kill_"></a>Implementing interface
SetterLauncher.kill()<br>
</h3>



<p><code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code> does provide a basic
implementation of the <code>kill()</code> method.&nbsp; This amounts to
shutting down the <code>Process</code> created by <code>doLaunch()</code>.&nbsp;
This simple shutdown of the process is not suffiicent in most
cases.&nbsp; Sub-classes should override <code>kill()</code> to first
reset the third party technology to some default state before killing
the process.&nbsp; As such, an override of <code>kill()</code> should be
written to first reset the technology's configuration, and then call <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code>'s
version of <code>kill()</code> to actually shut it down.<br>

<h2><a name="Summary"></a>Summary</h2>



<p>This document has described various utility methods of the Control
Hub and the <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code> class that are useful
for implementing a configuration plug-in.&nbsp; It described how to
retrieve global properties of the plug-in from the Control Hub, and how
to use the basic implementation in <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code>
to acquire its local properites.&nbsp; It also described utilities that <code>AbstractSetterLauncher</code>
provides for, namely:<br>
