<h1>Web-4-All Architecture</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The purpose of this document is to provide a brief overview of
Web-4-All's architecture. </p>
<p>The Web-4-All system is made up of a number of independent modules.
They are "independent" in the sense that each performs its own function
without regard to how the others are operating, except where they
interface. This document describes the role of each module and how it
interacts with the rest of the system. </p>
<p> The architecture is diagrammed in Figure one.  The arrows indicate
the flow of information. The nature of the information is described
below in the section for each module.  A module drawn in dashed outline
(e.g., Server) indicates that it is not implemented in the current
Web-4-All system, but shows how the system could be expanded. </p>

</div>
<hr>
<p>The majority of the system is written in Java<span class="trademark">TM</span>
in order to ensure maximum platform independence. The exceptions are at
the front and back ends of the system.<br>
</p>
<p>At the front end, Web-4-All uses smart cards to store user
preferences.&nbsp; Smart card technology is significantly dependent on
factors such as the smart card chip, the chip's operating system, the
card reader device, and OS-specific software for that card reader. As a
result, Web-4-All is not platform independent with respect to its smart
card interface.<br>
</p>
<p>At the back end, the preferences and configuration plug-ins are
designed for specific third party software that runs on a particular
operating system.&nbsp; Examples include IBM's Home Page Reader for
Windows98, and the ATRC's onscreen keyboard for Windows. Since plug-ins
configure these third party technologies, platform dependence cannot be
avoided.<br>
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Web-4-All was designed to minimize platform
dependencies, especially within its core, and to push dependencies out
to the fringe where Web-4-All interacts with the OS and its hardware.</p>
<h2>Preference Loader Module</h2>
<p>The preferences document is stored using XML.&nbsp; Web-4-All uses
the "accessForAll" schema of the <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/accessibility/index.cfm" title="Welcome to IMS Global Learning Consortium: Specification: Accessibility">IMS</a> Learner Information Package, or LIP. The accessForAll branch of the LIP is
referred to herein as the "ACCLIP".</p>
<p>The purpose of the Preferences Loader is to read and write the
user's preferences document.&nbsp; The Preferences Loader has a generic
API so as to not be bound to any particular storage medium.&nbsp;
Examples of such media are smart cards, local file systems, and network
servers.&nbsp; The current implementation of the Preferences Loader API
is for smart cards.&nbsp; The current implementation of the Preferences
Loader API is for smart cards, and uses the OpenCard framework (<a href="http://www.opencard.org" title="Welcome to OpenCard !">www.opencard.org</a>).</p>
A word of caution:&nbsp; In actual fact, the smart card Preferences
Loader does not store a full ACCLIP document on the smart card due to
the limited memory available (it can be as little as 2k bytes).&nbsp;
The smart card Preferences Loader contains a low memory-binding device
that transforms a full ACCLIP into a reduced vocabulary version.&nbsp;
That version is then compressed before being stored on the smart
card.&nbsp; The reverse is also true. When the preferences document is
read from the card, the smart card Preferences Loader decompresses and
then expands the preferences to the full ACCLIP vocabulary.&nbsp; As
such, a preferences document retrieved directly from the smart card is
not an ACCLIP document.&nbsp; The document must first pass through the
low memory-binding device (or something functionally equivalent), in
order to retrieve the full ACCLIP elements and their attributes.&nbsp;
Note this is done only because of the limited memory available on smart
cards.&nbsp; The low memory binding software need not be used for a
hard disk or file server implementation of the Preferences Loader.
<h2>Control Hub<br>
</h2>
<p>The purpose of the Control Hub is to act as a coordinator and relay
among the other modules of the system.&nbsp; In particular, it:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>acquires a preferences document from the Preferences Loader.</li>
  <li>requests that the Preferences Loader store a preferences document.</li>
  <li>requests that the Preferences Wizard Manager launch a wizard to
create a new preferences document, or edit an existing one.<br>
  </li>
  <li>request that the Configuration Manager configure the workstation
based on a preferences document.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Figure one, there is an octagon labelled "Plug-in Information"
that feeds into the Control Hub.&nbsp; This is not a module of the
system per se, but represents data that the Control Hub consults on
behalf of the Preferences Wizard Manager and Configuration
Manager.&nbsp; Specifically, this data contains information about the
various plug-ins that the two managers invoke.<br>
</p>
<h2 class="h2bh">Preferences Wizard Manager</h2>
<p>The Preferences Wizard Manager has two purposes.&nbsp; First, it has
a built-in preferences wizard that enables users to create or edit
preferences documents.&nbsp; In this regard it allows users to set
"universal" or "common" preferences for different types of adaptive
technology.&nbsp; For example, screen readers typically have a setting
for volume, and the built-in wizard has a dialog for such a
setting.&nbsp; In point of fact, the built-in wizard has preference
dialogs for all of the ACCLIP's generic control and display preferences.<br>
</p>
<p>Secondly, the ACCLIP allows additional preferences to be set for
specific third party applications.&nbsp; The Preferences Wizard Manager
has a plug-in feature enabling third parties to create a link to their
own preferences wizard so users can set preferences that are specific
to that application.</p>
<p>The responsibility of a Preferences Wizard Manager plug-in is
twofold.&nbsp; It must launch the third party preferences wizard and
return any settings back to the Preferences Wizard Manager. These
specific third party preferences must be returned in the form specified
by the ACCLIP.&nbsp; The Preferences Wizard Manager then incorporates
them into the preferences document. </p>
<h2>Configuration Manager Module</h2>
<p>The purpose of the Configuration Manager is to configure the work
station and third party technologies according to the preferences
document, and to launch a Web browser. It does this by matching what the
user has requested in terms of assistive technologies and what is
actually present on the system as closely as possible.&nbsp; It
determines the latter by querying the Control Hub for information about
configuration plug-ins.&nbsp; When it finds the plug-in that best
matches the user's preference settings, it passes the relevant portion
of the ACCLIP to that plug-in, leaving it to perform the bulk of the
work.</p>
<p>The ACCLIP information passed to a configuration plugin includes
generic preferences set by the built-in preferences wizard, and any
specific preferences set by an external third party preferences
wizard.&nbsp; Configuration plug-ins are expected to transform all
relevant settings from the ACCLIP into a form that the third party
technology understands, configure that technology, and launch it.&nbsp;
When the user indicates that they are terminating the session (e.g., by
removing their smart card), the plug-in resets and shuts down the third
party software.&nbsp; The Configuration Manager calls upon the plug-in
to perform its clean up based on some event that indicates that the
user is finished.<br>
</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This describes the essential features of the Web-4-All system.&nbsp;
The following documents provide additional details about the various
components and how to implement preference wizard and configuration
plug-ins.</p>
