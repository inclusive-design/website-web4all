		<accomodationDescription>
			Pat may take the reading test in a private room using a refreshable Braille display and extra testing time (1.25 times the regular amount of time). He may not use text-to-speech technology (such as a screen reader) to have test content read to him, though he may use it (with the volume off) if it is necessary to drive the refreshable Braille display.
